 **Introduction**  
 PyBank & Pypoll Data
  
 **Data Description** 
 The dataset budget_data.csv  is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses"
  
**Analysis** 
The script starts by getting the financial data from a CSV file using the read_csv() function.

Total Months: Found by counting the number of records in the dataset. (line 14)
Net Total Profit/Losses: Calculated by adding up all the profits and losses. (line 16)
Average Change in Profit/Losses: Figured out by finding the average difference between consecutive months.(Line 18 - 19)
Greatest Increase and Decrease in Profit/Losses: Discovered along with the months they happened. (Line 21 to 27)
After finishing the financial analysis, the format_output() function creates a readable summary with the total months, total profit/loss, average change, and the biggest profit increases and decreases. (line 29 to 36)
Finally, the script prints out these results for you to see.(Line 53)

**Results** 
-The dataset covers a specific period, giving us an overview of the company's financial performance during that time.
*Adding up all the profits and losses shows us the overall financial outcome. This tells us whether the company made a profit or loss during the reviewed period.
-Calculating the average change between months helps us see how the company's finances evolved over time. A positive change means steady growth, while a negative one indicates a decline.
-Identifying the months with the highest profit increases and decreases helps us find important times of financial success or trouble. Figuring out what caused these changes can give us useful insights into how the company works and how outside factors impact its profits.
